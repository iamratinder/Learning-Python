# As the name suggests, while loops execute statements while the condition is True.
# As soon as the condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop.

i = 0       # while loop requires relevant variables to be ready
while i<=3:
    print(i)
    i = i+1     # remember the updation of variable (otherwise loop will continue forever)
